# 🎮 **AmazonQ Game Studio — Advanced Python/Pygame Collection**

Welcome to **AmazonQ Game Studio**, a curated showcase of **three advanced Python games** built entirely with **Pygame**, custom physics, handcrafted particle effects, smooth gameplay loops, and procedural audio.

Every game in this repository is created **from scratch**, no external assets or templates.  
This collection demonstrates strong foundations in **game programming, math, rendering, UI/UX**, and **real-time system design**.

## 🎮 **Included Games**

| File | Game Title | Genre | Summary |
|------|------------|--------|---------|
| `game.py` | ⚡ **Escape Rush** | Reflex Runner | Dash, dodge, boost, and survive in a neon-lit high-speed challenge. |
| `game2.py` | 🛡️ **Stellar Defender** | Space Shooter | Battle waves of enemies, collect upgrades, and protect the galaxy. |
| `game3.py` | 🐍 **Quantum Serpent** | Reinvented Snake | A futuristic twist on Snake with glowing physics-based movement. |
